    "# What is Apache Cassandra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra is a NoSQL distributed database. By design, NoSQL databases are lightweight, open-source, non-relational, and largely distributed. Counted among their strengths are horizontal scalability, distributed architectures, and a flexible approach to schema definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases enable rapid, ad-hoc organization and analysis of extremely high-volume, disparate data types. Thatâ€™s become more important in recent years, with the advent of Big Data and the need to rapidly scale databases in the cloud. Cassandra is among the NoSQL databases that have addressed the constraints of previous data management technologies, such as SQL databases.  "
